# Sunshine Meteo App
Simple Meteo App by following Udacity tutorials on Android

In order to get up and running with Android Development, I chose to follow some [Android Video Lessons from
Udacity], which I found out being an interesting and enjoyable way of approaching Android development.

# Synopsis

A simple Meteo app has been chosen has an example of a common situation occurring in most of Android apps:
a main ListView which leads to a DetailedView whenever clicking on one of the items.
This is also known as ***"master-detail" flow***.

If the deviceâ€™s screen size can accommodate showing both the list and the details, two fragments will
be used, all the information being visible at one time.
Otherwise, just one is used and the user must click to get deeper details of an element from the list4.
